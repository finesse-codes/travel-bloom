## Travel Recommendations

This is a final project for the Coursera Course JavaScript Programming Essentials.
The goal was to use javascript and the Fetch API to search a JSON object and display travel recommendations based on user input.

### challenge

I I usually use Vue JS to make websites, so I found it frustrating to copy and paste whole pages to go to the “about” page, for example. And if you change the navigation, you would have to update it on every page.

### solution

I decided to use vanilla javascript to create my own version of a single page application. I wrote a function that replaces the content of the index page when a navigation link is clicked. This loads very quickly.

I used tailwind for the css, which I think is easier to maintain.
